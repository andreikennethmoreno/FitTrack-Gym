Description of System : 

The  Fit Track Gym Management System  is a Python-based terminal application designed to manage gym memberships and log entries efficiently. This system allows gym administrators to add and remove members, track membership durations, and log gym sessions for both members and non-members. Key features include:

- Membership Management: Add new members with details like full name, contact, registration date, and membership duration. The system calculates and stores the expiration date automatically. It also supports removing members when needed.


- Session Logging: Log gym sessions with timestamps for check-in and check-out, tracking both members and non-members.


- Data Viewing: Display all current members and their details, as well as view logs of all sessions, formatted for readability using the tabulate library.


- Interactive Interface: A simple command-line interface guides users through different functionalities, making it user-friendly for gym administrators to manage their operations.


The system is implemented using Python's datetime and tabulate libraries, ensuring accurate date handling and well-organized data presentation.
